    abstract = {For recommender systems that base their product rankings primarily on a measure of similarity between items and the user query, it can often happen that products on the recommendation list are highly similar to each other and lack diversity. In this article we argue that the motivation of diversity research is to increase the probability of retrieving unusual or novel items which are relevant to the user and introduce a methodology to evaluate their performance in terms of novel item retrieval. Moreover, noting that the retrieval of a set of items matching a user query is a common problem across many applications of information retrieval, we formulate the trade-off between diversity and matching quality as a binary optimization problem, with an input control parameter allowing explicit tuning of this trade-off. We study solution strategies to the optimization problem and demonstrate the importance of the control parameter in obtaining desired system performance. The methods are evaluated for collaborative recommendation using two datasets and case-based recommendation using a synthetic dataset constructed from the public-domain Travel dataset.},

    abstract = {The Recommender Systems community is paying increasing attention to novelty and diversity as key qualities beyond accuracy in real recommendation scenarios. Despite the raise of interest and work on the topic in recent years, we find that a clear common methodological and conceptual ground for the evaluation of these dimensions is still to be consolidated. Different evaluation metrics have been reported in the literature but the precise relation, distinction or equivalence between them has not been explicitly studied. Furthermore, the metrics reported so far miss important properties such as taking into consideration the ranking of recommended items, or whether items are relevant or not, when assessing the novelty and diversity of recommendations.We present a formal framework for the definition of novelty and diversity metrics that unifies and generalizes several state of the art metrics. We identify three essential ground concepts at the roots of novelty and diversity: choice, discovery and relevance, upon which the framework is built. Item rank and relevance are introduced through a probabilistic recommendation browsing model, building upon the same three basic concepts. Based on the combination of ground elements, and the assumptions of the browsing model, different metrics and variants unfold. We report experimental observations which validate and illustrate the properties of the proposed metrics.},

abstract = {Case-based reasoning systems usually accept the conventional similarity assumption during retrieval, preferring to retrieve a set of cases that are maximally similar to the target problem.

This is especially true in case-based recommender systems. In this paper we propose and evaluate strategies for improving retrieval diversity in CBR systems without compromising similarity or efficiency.},

    abstract = {Many recommendation systems suggest items to users by utilizing the techniques of  collaborative filtering (CF) based on historical records of items that the users have viewed, purchased, or rated. Two major problems that most CF approaches have to contend with are scalability and sparseness of the user profiles. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we describe a CF algorithm  alternating-least-squares with weighted-   -regularization (ALS-WR), which is implemented on a parallel Matlab platform. We show empirically that the performance of ALS-WR (in terms of  root mean squared error (RMSE)) monotonically improves with both the number of features and the number of ALS iterations. We applied the ALS-WR algorithm on a large-scale CF problem, the Netflix Challenge, with 1000 hidden features and obtained a RMSE score of 0.8985, which is one of the best results based on a pure method. In addition, combining with the parallel version of other known methods, we achieved a performance improvement of 5.91% over Netflix's own CineMatch recommendation system. Our method is simple and scales well to very large datasets.},

Collaborative filtering has become one of the most used approaches to provide personalized services for users. The key of this approach is to find similar users or items using user-item rating matrix so that the system can show recommendations for users. However, most approaches related to this approach are based on similarity algorithms, such as cosine, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean squared difference. These methods are not much effective, especially in the cold user conditions. This paper presents a new user similarity model to improve the recommendation performance when only few ratings are available to calculate the similarities for each user. The model not only considers the local context information of user ratings, but also the global preference of user behavior. Experiments on three real data sets are implemented and compared with many state-of-the-art similarity measures. The results show the superiority of the new similarity model in recommended performance.},

In this paper we present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7% better than the score of Netflix's own system.},

   abstract = {Recommender systems are an important part of the information and e-commerce ecosystem. They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. This paper discusses a~wide variety of the choices available and their implications, aiming to provide both practicioners and researchers with an introduction to the important issues underlying recommenders and current best practices for addressing these issues.},

To what extent and in which ways recommender systems create business value is, however, much less clear, and the literature on the topic is scattered. In this research commentary, we review existing publications on field tests of recommender systems and report which business-related performance measures were used in such real-world deployments. We summarize common challenges of measuring the business value in practice and critically discuss the value of algorithmic improvements and offline experiments as commonly done in academic environments. Overall, our review indicates that various open questions remain both regarding the realistic quantification of the business effects of recommenders and the performance assessment of recommendation algorithms in&nbsp;academia.},

As described by Luhn, one part of a larger idea, the business intelligence system, was Selective Dissemination of Information. SDI involves the use of the computer to select from a flow of new documents, those of interest to each of a number of users. This process may be thought of as the inverse of information retrieval. In information retrieval, a user precipitates a search of a file of documents. In SDI a document precipitates the search of a standing file of user interests. SDI has been called "current awareness" since the attempt is to keep the user aware of current developments. This function has been traditional with those few really excellent librarians and executive staff assistants. SDI is a mechanization of this function.},

    abstract = {This paper discussed the most commonly used similarity measures in Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender system. In addition, the author introduced some recommendations related to CF system quality improvement which should be considered in the process of formulating similarity measure that may lead to alleviating the issue of data sparsity and some existing measures shortcomings. Generally, CF approach is one of the most widely used and most successful methods for the recommendation system, such as e-commerce. CF system introduced items to the user based on his/her previous ratings and the ratings of his/her neighbors. Therefore, the most important stage in CF system is locating the successful neighbor. Nevertheless, the sparsity of data is the major issue faced by the memory-based CF. The reason behind this is that many of the users rated a few number of items from the huge number of available items. This has encouraged many researchers to provide solutions. One of these solutions was by proposing or updating similarities measures take in considerations the global information preference, all ratings provided by users, the size of common ratings, and so on. In this work, the researcher discussed these measures alongside with their limitations. In addition, the researcher also listed some advices that are important in the process of locating successful neighbors, which may help researchers to improve the quality of CF system.},

GroupLens is a system for collaborative filtering of netnews, to help people find articles they will like in the huge stream of available articles. News reader clients display predicted scores and make it easy for users to rate articles after they read them. Rating servers, called Better Bit Bureaus, gather and disseminate the ratings. The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction. The entire architecture is open: alternative software for news clients and Better Bit Bureaus can be developed  independently and can interoperate with the components we have developed.},

    abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most successful approach for personalized product or service recommendations. Neighborhood based collaborative filtering is an important class of CF, which is simple, intuitive and efficient product recommender system widely used in commercial domain. Typically, neighborhood-based CF uses a similarity measure for finding similar users to an active user or similar products on which she rated. Traditional similarity measures utilize ratings of only co-rated items while computing similarity between a pair of users. Therefore, these measures are not suitable in a sparse data. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure for neighborhood based CF, which uses all ratings made by a pair of users. Proposed measure finds importance of each pair of rated items by exploiting Bhattacharyya similarity. To show effectiveness of the measure, we compared performances of neighborhood based CFs using state-of-the-art similarity measures with the proposed measured based CF. Recommendation results on a set of real data show that proposed measure based CF outperforms existing measures based CFs in various evaluation metrics.},

The most critical component of the method is the mechanism of finding similarities among users using product ratings data so that products can be recommended based on the similarities. The calculation of similarities has relied on traditional distance and vector similarity measures such as Pearson's correlation and cosine which, however, have been seldom questioned in terms of their effectiveness in the recommendation problem domain. This paper presents a new heuristic similarity measure that focuses on improving recommendation performance under cold-start conditions where only a small number of ratings are available for similarity calculation for each user. Experiments using three different datasets show the superiority of the measure in new user cold-start conditions.},

Content-based recommenders rely on the concept of similarity between the bought/ searched/ visited item and all the items stored in a repository. It is a common belief that the user is interested in what is similar to what she has already bought/searched/visited. We believe that there are some contexts in which this assumption is wrong: it is the case of acquiring unsearched but still useful items or pieces of information. This is called serendipity. Our purpose is to stimulate users and facilitate these serendipitous encounters to happen.This paper presents the design and implementation of a hybrid recommender system that joins a content-based approach and serendipitous heuristics in order to mitigate the over-specialization problem with surprising suggestions.},

In this paper, six properties are discussed: (Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates, and Babies), each of which a sparsity measure should have. The main contributions of this paper are the proofs and the associated summary table which classify commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions. Only two of these measures satisfy all six: the pq-mean with p ≤ 1, q &gt; 1 and the Gini Index.},

    abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition,
    computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep
    neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this
    work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem
    in recommendation --- collaborative filtering --- on the basis of implicit feedback.Although
    some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used
    it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic
    features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering
    --- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix
    factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items.By
    replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary
    function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based
    Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization
    under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose
    to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function.
    Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of
    our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows
    that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},
