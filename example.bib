We also describe the role of search and related algorithms, which for us turns into a recommendations problem as well. We explain the motivations behind and review the approach that we use to improve the recommendation algorithms, combining A/B testing focused on improving member retention and medium term engagement, as well as offline experimentation using historical member engagement data. We discuss some of the issues in designing and interpreting A/B tests. Finally, we describe some current areas of focused innovation, which include making our recommender system global and language aware.},

   abstract = {Recommender systems are an important part of the information and e-commerce ecosystem. They represent a powerful method for enabling users to filter through large information and product spaces. Nearly two decades of research on collaborative filtering have led to a varied set of algorithms and a rich collection of tools for evaluating their performance. Research in the field is moving in the direction of a richer understanding of how recommender technology may be embedded in specific domains. The differing personalities exhibited by different recommender algorithms show that recommendation is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Specific tasks, information needs, and item domains represent unique problems for recommenders, and design and evaluation of recommenders needs to be done based on the user tasks to be supported. Effective deployments must begin with careful analysis of prospective users and their goals. Based on this analysis, system designers have a host of options for the choice of algorithm and for its embedding in the surrounding user experience. This paper discusses a~wide variety of the choices available and their implications, aiming to provide both practicioners and researchers with an introduction to the important issues underlying recommenders and current best practices for addressing these issues.},

   abstract = {Recommender Systems are nowadays successfully used by all major web sites—from e-commerce to social media—to filter content and make suggestions in a personalized way. Academic research largely focuses on the value of recommenders for consumers, e.g., in terms of reduced information overload. To what extent and in which ways recommender systems create business value is, however, much less clear, and the literature on the topic is scattered. In this research commentary, we review existing publications on field tests of recommender systems and report which business-related performance measures were used in such real-world deployments. We summarize common challenges of measuring the business value in practice and critically discuss the value of algorithmic improvements and offline experiments as commonly done in academic environments. Overall, our review indicates that various open questions remain both regarding the realistic quantification of the business effects of recommenders and the performance assessment of recommendation algorithms in&nbsp;academia.},

   abstract = {Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) is a new and rapidly developing field. The concept was originally set forth by Hans Peter Luhn in 1958. As described by Luhn, one part of a larger idea, the business intelligence system, was Selective Dissemination of Information. SDI involves the use of the computer to select from a flow of new documents, those of interest to each of a number of users. This process may be thought of as the inverse of information retrieval. In information retrieval, a user precipitates a search of a file of documents. In SDI a document precipitates the search of a standing file of user interests. SDI has been called "current awareness" since the attempt is to keep the user aware of current developments. This function has been traditional with those few really excellent librarians and executive staff assistants. SDI is a mechanization of this function.},
